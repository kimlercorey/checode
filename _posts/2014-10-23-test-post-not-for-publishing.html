This is a test post which tests out a few new items promised yesterday including:
<ul>
	<li>Use of markdown. (Using pretty press we also have live preview while writing the post itself - check it out as it is pretty cool)</li>
	<li>Sync with github (in theory this will work but not fully finctioning as expected yet)</li>
	<li>new additional optimizations to the workflow including a calendar view, comments, groups and some meta info which will allow us to include the link to the trello ticket and the such</li>
</ul>
Feel free to click around and experiment with the new items. test test- test

test:
Making an additional change to post directly in github... 
Desired outcome is to auto post into wordpress post....

wondering if it overwrites the text I placed in WP
